# 'Planning for Drunks'

This project is the assessment 2 for the module **GEOG5995M Programming for Social Science: Core Skills** and consists in the design of an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates drunk people on their way back home after a night out in the town's pub. 

To run it three files (in the folder `Code and data`) are needed: 

- the drunks-model.py (code of the model),
- the drunkframework.py (code for the class), and
- the drunk.plan.txt (the environment data map).

Then, follow these steps:

1st. Open Spyder (IDE) in your computer and add the three files in the editor.
 
2nd. Run the drunkframework.py file first, and then the drunks-model.py file - In approx 10 sec. you should see a map with the drunks in their home and a new file called environment.density.txt will have appeared in the `Code and data` folder with the density of the drunk's steps printed.
