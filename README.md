# 'Planning for Drunks'

This project is the assessment 2 for the module **GEOG5995M Programming for Social Science: Core Skills** and consists in the design of an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates drunk people on their way back home after a night out in the town's pub. 

Instructions to run it:

Three files that you will find in the folder `Code and data` are necessary: 

- the drunks-model.py (the model code),
- the drunkframework.py (the class code), and
- the drunk.plan.txt (the environment data map).

1st. Open Spyder (IDE) in your computer and add the three files above in the editor.
 
2nd. Run first the drunkframework.py file, and then the drunks-model.py file. In approx 10 sec. you will see a map with the drunks and their steps density in the console, as well as a new file called environment.density.txt in the `Code and data` folder.
