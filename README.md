#'Planning for Drunks'

This project is the assessment 2 for the module **GEOG5995M Programming for Social Science: Core Skills** and consists in the design of an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates drunk people on their way back home after a night out in the town's pub.

Instructions to run it:

1st. Make sure that the general folder 201081646_GEOG5995M is unzipped.

2nd. Open Spyder (IDE) in your computer and add to the editor the three files that you will find in the `Code and data` folder (inside GEOG5995M_Assessment_2):

- the drunks-model.py (the model code);
- the drunkframework.py (the class code); and
- the drunk.plan.txt (the environment data map).

3rd. Run first the drunkframework.py file, and then the drunks-model.py file. In approx 10 secondes you will see a map with the drunks and their steps' density in the console, as well as a new file called environment.density.txt in the `Code and data` folder.
