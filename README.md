# 'Planning for Drunks'

This agent-based model (ABM) is the assessment 2 for the module **GEOG5995M Programming for Social Science: Core Skills** and simulates drunk people on their way back home from the town's pub.   

To run the model three files (in the folder `Code and data`) are needed: 

- the drunks-model.py (code of the model),
- the drunkframework.py (code for the class), and
- the drunk.plan.txt (the environment data map).

Instructions how to run it:

1st. Open Spyder (IDE) in your computer and add the three files in the editor.
 
2nd. Run the drunkframework.py file first, and then the drunks-model.py file - In approx 10 sec. you should see a map with the drunks in their home and a new file called environment.density.txt will have appeared in the `Code and data` folder with the density of the drunk's steps printed.
